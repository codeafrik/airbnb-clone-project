### ✅ Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Understanding the color scheme and typography from Figma ensures:

- Visual consistency across all components
- Alignment with the design team’s expectations
- Faster development through reusable styles
- Better collaboration and visual QA

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

To maintain scalability and reusability, the following components will be built:

### 🔼 Navbar

- Platform logo
- Location-based search bar
- User profile menu (Login / Profile dropdown)
- Hamburger menu on smaller screens

### 🏘 Property Card

- Image thumbnail
- Property name, price, and location
- Rating stars and favorite (heart) icon
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

### 🔽 Footer

- Site links (About, Help Center)
- Company and legal info
- Social media icons

Each component will follow **component-based architecture** (e.g., React functional components with props) and support reuse across multiple pages.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

- **Mobile-first design**
- **Component modularity** using React
- **Semantic HTML** and ARIA for accessibility
- **Responsive layout** using Flexbox and/or Grid
- **Clean file structure** (e.g., `/components`, `/pages`, `/styles`)
- **Version control** with Git and meaningful commit messages
